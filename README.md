🕵️‍♂️ Subsidy Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a complete end-to-end **Machine Learning web application** designed to detect potential fraud in government subsidy claims. It allows citizens to submit subsidy applications online while an ML model evaluates the authenticity of each submission in real-time.

🚀 Features

        🔍 **ML-Based Fraud Detection** – Detect suspicious subsidy applications.
        🧠 **Custom-Trained Model** – Built and trained from scratch on simulated data.
        🌐 **Flask Web App** – User-friendly interface for real-time prediction.
        📝 **Form Submission** – Collects basic user and subsidy domain data.
        ⚙️ **Modular Codebase** – Easy to extend for other ML tasks.

📊 ML Model Details

        **Algorithm**: Random Forest 
        **Data**: Simulated subsidy claims with labels
        **Output**: `fraud` or `not fraud`

 Future Improvements
        ✅ Add a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) for storing application history
        ✅ Add admin dashboard to review flagged applications
        ✅ Use real government data (if available)
        ✅ Deploy on cloud (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
